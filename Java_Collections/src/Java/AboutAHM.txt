Airplane health Management is a diagnostic maintenance aid designed to assist in determining maintenance needs while an 
airplane is operating

How AHM works-
1. Airplane transmits data while in flight which AHM collects and sends to ground operations
2. AHM parses, compiles and analyzes data and notifies the personnel of issues according to custom set criteria
3. Airline staff  take advantage of AHMs fault analysis , fix recommendations etc to take action on the issues affecting
dispatch and schedule
4. AHM benefits the airline with reduced delays, cancellations, reduced unscheduled maintenance etc
